                <br><br> In the 2020 edition, the World Happiness Report looks at six key variables to evaluate the levels of happiness 
                around the world, which are: <b>GDP per capita</b>, <b>social support</b>, <b>healthy life expectancy</b>, <b>freedom to make life choices</b>, 
                <b>generosity</b>, and <b>freedom from corruption</b> (World Happiness Report).
